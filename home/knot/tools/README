Tools for benchmarking & compliance testing.

zone-generate.py -h
 * tool for artificial zone generation including most known RR types
 * consult -h for help

zone-typelist.sh <origin> <zonefile>
 * briefly parses through zone and build zone dictionary
 * that is selected pairs of TYPE record_name
 * dictionary is used for zone-pcapgen.py to generate testing pcap file

zone-pcapgen.py
 * creates compliance testing pcap file from given zone dictionary
 * see -h for help

zone-pcapgen-bench.py
 * creates a trace file for benchmarking, requires .dict file from zone-typelist.sh
 * there is no builtin way to introduce queries to nonexistent names, you may extend the result file

pcat-analyze.py
 * analyze two outputs from pcat tool for differences (pcat in: http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/ldns/trunk )
 * differences are analyzed in a semantic way, no templates are needed
 * only a few RR dissectors are in place, will be developed further
 * case of domain names and RR rotation is ignored
 * see -h for help

digcmp.py
 * parses "dig" output into a normalized form for later comparison

dns-tcp2udp.py
 * DNS TCP -> UDP tunneling

pcap-fuzz.py
 * introduce random errors into DNS packets in a pcap file

pcat2pcap.sh
 * transform the "pcat" tool result into a pcap file

Disclaimer: tools may contain some rough edges.
